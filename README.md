# OVERSEER

**Welcome to Overseer!**

## Project Overview:
Overseer is an immersive gaming experience currently in development using the
Unity framework by a passionate team of three engineering students. We proudly
represent "OwO" Studios, and we are excited to introduce our unique
project to you.

## Game Concept:
Overseer is a hide-and-seek inspired multiplayer game that unfolds in the Unity
gaming environment. The gameplay involves a single player in virtual reality
(VR) facing off against 1 to 3 players on PC. The PC players assume the roles
of Ghostsâ€”small, agile entities tasked with mimicking the behavior of artificial
intelligence to remain undetected. On the other side, the player in VR becomes
the Observer, a massive entity with the responsibility of tracking down
these elusive Ghosts.

## Your Choices Matter:
Will you embrace the role of the Ghosts, working to liberate your people from
oppression? Alternatively, will you take on the mantle of the Observer and
quell the revolt once and for all? The outcome rests in your hands.

## Installation Instructions:
For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the manual provided
with the game. The manual will guide you through the setup process,
ensuring you get the most out of your Overseer experience.

Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey. Get ready to immerse
yourself in the captivating world of Overseer!
